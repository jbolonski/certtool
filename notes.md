# Notes

### The Report Page

The Report should be called "Certificate Expiration Report"

The Report should indicate the last time the certificates were scanned.

The report shows you the certificates that we are monitoring in a table format.

The table columns should be the certificate name and serial number, the Expiration Date, and finally the Days Until the cert expires.

The table should be sorted by expiration date descending.

The rows of the table should have highlighting based on how many days until it expires. If it is within 30 days it should be light red. If it is 31 to 60 days then it should be light yellow.


### The Admin Page

The Admin page should allow users to enter new host names to scan for certificate expiration.

The Admin page should allow you to delete host names from the list.
